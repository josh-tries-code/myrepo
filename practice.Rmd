## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here is another plot comparing the speed and distance of various car models

```{r distance by speed}
# Title of the code chunk is WITHIN the curly brackets above (only seen in code)
# Comments about the code can be made using '#' at the start of the line
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl, pch = 16)
``` 

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
####### Heading 7

Rich text is also available, including *italic*, **bold**, and ***bold italic***

You can make lists:

1. item 1
    2. item 2
       - item 3

 - item 1
    - item 2
      - item 3

* item 1
  * item 2


You can also add a link to a website, like my [github](https://github.com/josh-tries-code) page

You can alter how the document looks by clicking the gear (settings) icon at the top of the script panel, then output options
